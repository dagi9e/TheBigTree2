<p style="font-size: 150%;">Once there was a  <strong>Big Tree</strong> in the fields of <em>Papua New Guinea</em>. It was very tall and almost touched the sky.
Birds lived in it, insects lived in it, squarels and walabies too. It was a tree that all animals big and small could come and rest under.
But one day, man said he wanted to build a house. He looked and looked and his eyes rested on the big tree. However, he also saw that other creatures already made a house in that tree. Now he was faced with two choices;</p>
<ol style="font-size: 150%;">
    <li>
        <a href= '/cut' style="font-size: 150%;" >He chose to cut the tree </a></li>
    <br>
    <li>
        <a href = '/leave' style="font-size: 150%;">He chose to leave the tree for the animals.</a></li>
      
  </ol>
